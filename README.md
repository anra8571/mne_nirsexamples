# mne_nirsexamples
Team: Anna Rahn and Ishwar Choudhary

We are analyzing the Python mne_nirs package code from an object-oriented perspective, finding places where patterns may be useful, and recommending various improvements. 

All package recommendations are labelled with the comment "Recommendation: " so that the mne_nirs directory is easily searchable.

See visualizations.ipynb for examples of how to use the package and create data visualizations.
